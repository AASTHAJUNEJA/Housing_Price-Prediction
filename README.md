# Housing_Price-Prediction

This project was made under the supervision of our mentor Dr. Arti Jain in our minor 2019. I with my 3 other 
friends implemented this project using various machine learning algorithms and we find it really interesting .
The problem statement consists of given certain features like size of the house,latitude, longitude,no. of bedrooms,etc.. of a particular house and we have to
predict/estimate the price of that house.
We have worked upon Linear Regression(both univariate and multivariate), Decision tree regressor(for single feature and multiple features) and
Random forest Regressor(for single feature and multiple features). We did a lot of Data cleaning before proceeding and get rid of redundant/useless features
and rows(number of houses).There is a lot of data visualization. We also find out that which is the most important feature.
The results from all the three alogrithms are compared on the basis of their accuracy. All details are mentioned in the report and the ppt which are attached.
